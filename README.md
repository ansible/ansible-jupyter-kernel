![Example Jupyter Usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible-jupyter-kernel/master/docs/example_session.png)

The Ansible [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Kernel adds a kernel backend for Jupyter to interface directly with Ansible and construct plays and tasks and execute them on the fly.

## Demo

## Installation:

`ansible-kernel` is available to be installed from pypi but you can also install it locally. The setup package itself will register the kernel
with `Jupyter` automatically.

### From pypi

    pip install ansible-kernel
    python -m ansible_kernel.install

### From a local checkout

    pip install -e .
    python -m ansible_kernel.install

### For Anaconda/Miniconda

    pip install ansible-kernel
    python -m ansible_kernel.install --sys-prefix

## Usage

### Local install

```
    jupyter notebook
    # In the notebook interface, select Ansible from the 'New' menu
```

### Container

    docker run -p 8888:8888 benthomasson/ansible-jupyter-kernel

    Then copy the URL from the output into your browser:
    http://localhost:8888/?token=ABCD1234


## Using the Cells

Normally `Ansible` brings together various components in different files and locations to launch a playbook and performs automation tasks. For this
`jupyter` interface you need to provide this information in cells by denoting what the cell contains and then finally writing your tasks that will make
use of them. There are [Examples](#examples) available to help you, in this section we'll go over the currently supported cell types.

In order to denote what the cell contains you should prefix it with a pound/hash symbol (#) and the type as listed here as the first line as shown in the examples
below.

#### #inventory

The inventory that your tasks will use

```
#inventory
[all]
ahost ansible_connection=local
anotherhost examplevar=val
```

#### #play

This represents the opening block of a typical `Ansible` play

```
#play
name: Hello World
hosts: all
gather_facts: false
```

#### #task

This is the default cell type if no type is given for the first line

```
#task
debug:
```

```
#task
shell: cat /tmp/afile
register: output
```

#### #host_vars

This takes an argument that represents the hostname.  Variables
defined in this file will be available in the tasks for that host.

```
#host_vars Host1
hostname: host1
```

#### #group_vars

This takes an argument that represents the group name.  Variables
defined in this file will be available in the tasks for hosts in that
group.

```
#group_vars BranchOfficeX
gateway: 192.168.1.254
```

#### #vars

This takes an argument that represents the filename for use in later cells

```
#vars example_vars
message: hello vars
```

```
#play
name: hello world
hosts: localhost
gather_facts: false
vars_files:
    - example_vars
```

#### #template

This takes an argument in order to create a templated file that can be used in later cells

```
#template hello.j2
{{ message }}
```

```
#task
template:
    src: hello.j2
    dest: /tmp/hello
```

#### #ansible.cfg

Provides overrides typically found in ansible.cfg

```
#ansible.cfg
[defaults]
host_key_checking=False
```

### Examples

You can find various [example notebooks in the repository](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-jupyter-kernel/tree/master/notebooks)

## Using the development environment

It's possible to use whatever python development process you feel comfortable with. The repository itself includes mechanisms for
using [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)

```
pipenv install
...
pipenv shell
```
